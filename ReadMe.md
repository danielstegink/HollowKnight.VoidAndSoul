# Void & Soul
Based on the Silksong mod Silk & Song, this mod adds a
0-notch charm, Void & Soul, which increases the player's 
power as they defeat enemies and complete in-game 
achievements.

Hollow Knight doesn't track kills the same way Silksong
does, so this mod tracks kills the player has made since
installing this mod by dividing enemies into various
categories based on their HP. The weakest enemies, namely
those with less than 50 HP, give 1 XP. On the other hand,
enemies with at least 1600 HP give 20 XP. You can also get 
XP from certain achievements, such as completing the 
Colosseum of Fools or acquiring the Kingsoul.

Each level you unlock gives 1 charm notch of value, 
divided evenly among the charm's 3 perks:
- Crit Bonus: Whenever an enemy takes damage, there is a 
chance the attack will be a critical hit and deal 2x 
damage. 
	- If your critical hit chance exceeds 100%, it will 
be halved and the damage will be doubled. So a 150% crit 
chance will become a 75% chance, but the critical hit will
deal 4x damage. 
	- You will know an attack was a critical hit
if the enemy flashes black once.
- Health Regen: You will periodically regain 1 Mask.
- SOUL Regen: You will periodically regain 1 SOUL.

By default, you can reasonable achieve level 1 before you
face the False Knight, and reach level 10 after defeating
all of the Dreamers. Both of these settings, and the 
maximum level of 100, can be customized via the mod menu.
